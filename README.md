# highlightInstructionChoose.py

This is an extension to a script by AGDCservices the script is called Highlight_Target_Instructions.py.

I took this script and built on it by adding some different features. I wanted the user to be able to choose which color to assign to the instruction they wanted to be given. There is also the option not to select the color and leave it as the default white. I included a list of colors in the script: red, blue, violet, green, yellow, orange, light grey, and dark grey. In the console, once you run the script will tell you that the first choice will highlight the call instructions, and the second choice will highlight the lea instructions. The third choice will highlight xor that doesnâ€™t zero out the register, common RC4 instructions, and misc math operations. The fourth choice will highlight string operations.
